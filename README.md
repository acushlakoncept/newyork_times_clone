# New York Times Article Page Clone

> In this project, my partner and I explored the different positioning skills ranging from inline-block, floats, position, flex, and grid.
> We gained a deeper understanding of how to position and properly layout elements on the page.
> We combined these different methods to achieve our goals by reproducing the clone of the [New York Times Article page](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0).

> One of our major challenges in this project was when we positioned a sprite image under where we have "The Theory of Inflation".

> In the course of the project, we learned and mastered the use of advanced CSS selectors which we used in styling most of the elements.

> We also worked on the responsive part of the page to fit into different screen sizes employing the media query techniques.
